# Project Architecture for Football Fantasy Analytics

## 1. Data Structure Overview

Key components:
- Round data (R1.json, etc.): Contains detailed information about:
  - Teams and standings
  - Individual matches
  - Player performance statistics
  - Player events (goals, substitutions, cards, etc.)
  - Player fantasy points
- Season data: Provides season-level summaries and match results
- Multiple data sources: Sofascore and Picas are different data providers

## 2. Data Processing Pipeline

```text
Raw JSON Files → Data Extraction → Processing → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Player Recommendation
```

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1. Data Extraction & Processing

- Database Schema: Create a relational database with these tables:
  - Players (id, name, position, etc.)
  - Teams (id, name, etc.)
  - Matches (id, date, home/away teams, etc.)
  - PlayerPerformances (player_id, match_id, points, events, etc.)
  - Seasons (id, year, etc.)
  - Rounds (id, season_id, etc.)
- ETL Scripts: Extract Transform Load processes to:
  - Parse JSON files
  - Normalize data into database tables
  - Handle multiple seasons and data sources
  - Clean and validate data

### 3.2. Analysis & Insight Generation

- Player Performance Analysis:
  - Calculate consistent metrics across seasons
  - Track player development over time
  - Compare against league averages
  - Identify trends (rising stars, declining veterans)
- Value Assessment:
  - Points per cost ratio
  - Consistency metrics
  - Performance against different types of opponents

### 3.3. Prediction & Recommendation Engine

- Machine Learning Models:
  - Player performance prediction
  - Player value/ROI prediction
  - Team optimization algorithms
- Recommendation System:
  - Based on budget constraints
  - Position requirements
  - Performance predictions
  - Optimal team composition

### 3.4. User Interface

- Team Builder:
  - Drag-and-drop interface
  - Budget tracking
  - Player recommendations
  - Performance projections
- Analytics Dashboard:
  - Performance visualizations
  - Player comparisons
  - Historical tracking
  - Team analysis

## 4. Technologies

### 4.1. Data Storage & Processing

- Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- ETL Framework: Python with Pandas/Numpy
- Data Analysis: Python scientific stack (pandas, scikit-learn)

### 4.2. API & Backend

- Web Framework: FastAPI or Django
- API Development: RESTful endpoints for frontend/model interaction

### 4.3. Frontend

- Web Interface: React with data visualization libraries
- Mobile: React Native (optional future extension)

### 4.4. ML/AI

- Model Development: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch
- Feature Engineering: Custom metrics derived from raw stats

## 5. Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1: Data Infrastructure

- Create ETL pipeline for importing all seasons
- Design and implement database schema
- Basic data cleaning and preparation

2. Phase 2: Analysis Engine

- Develop player performance metrics
- Build consistency scores
- Create position-specific evaluations
- Implement team performance analysis

3. Phase 3: Prediction Models

- Train ML models for performance prediction
- Develop team optimization algorithms
- Create recommendation engine

4. Phase 4: User Interface

- Build team management interface
- Develop visualization dashboards
- Implement recommendation system in the UI

## 6. Key Metrics for Player Evaluation

Based on the data available:
- Fantasy points per game/season
- Consistency (standard deviation of performance)
- Minutes played
- Goals/assists/defensive actions
- Value (points per cost)
- Matchup performance (how players do against specific teams)
- Home vs. away performance

## 7. Advanced Features

- Fixture Difficulty Analysis: Evaluate upcoming matches
- Form Tracker: Recent performance trends
- Injury Prediction: Based on historical data and playing time
- Team Chemistry: How players perform with specific teammates
- Differential Players: Undervalued assets for gaining advantage
- Transfer Market Prediction: When to buy/sell players
